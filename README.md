# Console Finances

## Description 

This webpage contains JavaScript logic to analyse the dataset which was provided. I have written the JavaScript code to fulfil the requirements that were outlined. It has been a great opportunity for me to apply the knowledge learned over the last week to instruct the computer to perform analysis on a dataset.

I've also gone slightly further to increase readibility of the console messages in two ways:
* Adding commas for large numbers.
    * (e.g. \$100,000,000 instead of $100000000).
* Ensuring that negative dollar values have their '-' sign before the dollar sign.
    * (e.g. -\$10,000 instead of \$-10,000)


Following this task, I've enhanced my skills to utilise JavaScript and the relevant methods to perform this Financial Analysis. I look forward to using and learning more JavaScript methods to perform my complex analysis and operations.
